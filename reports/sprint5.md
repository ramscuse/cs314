## Planned Epics  

### Tour Protocol
This epic will setup the tour framework for the website. Based on this framework the further epics related to Tour will be able to be completed. To complete this epic the schemas will need to be updated, the tour feature will need to be added to the server and tests will need to be written to ensure everything is working correctly.

### Find Places
The user wants to be able to search for a specific location to add to their trip, based on the value of a single string. After entering a string to search for, the user should see a list of places matching their criteria, they should then be able to select one or more of these locations and add it to their trip. The feature should also have the ability to randomly generate a list of locations. The "filters" of this feature should allow the user to specify the type of place as well as the country in which these places are generated.

### User Experience
We will talk to users of our application and have them demo and give feedback on its function and appearance. Preferably we will ask laymen to be our users. As a team we must agree upon and provide users with a standard set of questions to guide their user experience. We will also collect their demographic information (esp age and background). After their feedback we will have a team meeting and reassess our github issues to improve our product. (Design changes forthcoming).
